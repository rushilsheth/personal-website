auto-regression. auto meaning self. regression meaning predict. predict next token given previous tokens: `P(t_t | t_1, t_2, ..., t_{t-1})`. LLM training is self-surpervised learning.

## Overview

Objective of LLM is to predict the next word in a sequence of words. This is done by using a model that is trained on a large corpus of text.


Levels for dealing with LLMs:
1. Prompt Engineering: do not change any model parameters, only change the input prompt
2. Fine-tuning: change the model parameters to better fit the data. Update model params given task-specific data
3. Model Engineering: change the model architecture to better fit the data
